List (I) : Does have index numbers, accept dublicates,
size is automatically adjusted
implemented by : ArrayList(C), LinkedList(C), Vector (C)

    ArrayList: array based, internally uses array

    LinkedList(C) : each objects are doubly linked
                add() & remove () are faster than ArrayList
                get() is slower than arrayList

    Vector(C) : is synchronized --> thread safe
    slower than LinkedList & ArrayList

    has a child class : Stack

    Stack : LIFO
    pop():LIFO ==> Last In First Out
    removes the last object from the Stack

Set (I) : does not have index numbers, does not accept dublicates,
size is automatically adjusted
    Implemented by: HashSet(C), LinkedHashSet(C);

    HashSet: does not keep the order of the objects as it's

    LinkedHashSet : does keep the order of the objects as it's doubly linked

    extented by SortedSet(I)
    SortedSet(I): sorts the objects in ascending order, no dublicates.
    implemented by TreeSet


    synchronized keyword : used for achiving thread safety in multi-thread

        synchronized ==> Thread safe ==>
    multi-thread : multiple threads trying to get access to same resources
